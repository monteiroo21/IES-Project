# GitHub Flow
## Context
This **README** serves as a guide for the developers to work using the same workflow.

## Team Policies for using Git/Github
* Only work/add features/fix bugs in the **dev** branch;
* The code only migrates to the **main** branch to deploy releases and it's **DevOps's** responsability;
* Every time that there is a new feature to add or a bugfix to do, a **new** branch from the **dev** must be created;
* When there are more than one person working in a feature/bugfix, a branch may be also created for every major adition;
* Only confirm a pull request after, at least, another contributor checked it;
* Release pull requests are validated by the **Product Owner**.

*Every rule can have some exceptions in specific cases* 

## Working Branch
Go to the **dev**elopment branch. 
```bash
git checkout dev
git pull
```

## Issues
#### If there is no issue created for the work that you are going to do:
* create the issue and assign to yourself
* choose the repository's project in the **project** section
* leave page
* enter in the issue again and choose the current iteration in the **project** section

## Create a new branch
You are creating a branch either to work on a **feature** or a **bugfix**, for that you need to make a new branch with the following templates:
* `feature/<FEATURE_NAME>` - to add a new feature
* `bugfix/<WHAT_YOU_ARE_FIXING>` - to fix a bug
* `hotfix/<WHAT_YOU_ARE_FIXING>` - to fix an emergency bug in the **main** branch
* `refact/<FEATURE_YOU_ARE_REFACTORING>` - to continue/refactor a feature
* `docs/<DOCUMENTATION_NAME>` - to add/edit something about documentation

Both names need to be easy to understand of what is adding or what is fixing. Eg. **feature/menu**, **bugfix/menuLoading**.

#### Always check if you are in the **dev** branch!:
```bash
git branch
```

#### Finally, create the new branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/<placeholder>
```

*If you want to make a branch from a feature/bugfix, go to the desired branch and name it with the same beginning*

*Eg. feature/menu -> feature/menu/new_animation*

## Add, commit & push 
Try to add and commit every time you make big changes in important files
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "<message>"
```
#### The commits messages of a branch should follow the template
* `type: general idea of what the commit is doing`

#### Different types:
* `feat`
* `fix`
* `hfix`
* `refact`
* `docs`

#### Pushing for the first time
```bash
git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>
```
#### Pushing
```bash
git push
```

## Final Push
#### Rebasing
Before doing the **final** push, you need to **rebase** with the **dev** branch so the **pull request** is possible

First, go to the **dev** and **pull** to have the last version of the dev:
```bash
git checkout dev
git pull
```

Then, go back to your branch and rebase

```bash
git checkout you_branch
git rebase dev
```

#### Conflicts
If there are conflicts, you need to go to your editor and resolve them by selecting what do you want inside the **>>>HEAD   >>>branch** tags.

#### Every time you resolve a conflict do:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "rebasing dev"
git rebase --continue
```
#### Now you can push
```bash
git push
```
#### If occurs an error pushing and you did the rebasing correctly do:
##### Please double-check that the result of the rebase is the desired one
```bash
git push --force
```

## Pull Request
* Go to the repository and click in **Compare & pull request**;

### - Choose the **dev** branch in the **base!!!!!!!!**;
* For the template, you should add to the **url** the query parameter **&template=template_name.md**

For example: 
github.com/detiuaveiro/ies-24-25-group-project-203/compare/feature/new_feature?expand=1&template=feature_template.md

Check **docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE** for the templates that you can use

Possible templates:
* `bugfix_template.md`
* `docs_template.md`
* `feature_template.md`
* `hotfix_template.md`
* `refactor_template.md`

Now: 
* Choose a team member as a reviewer; 
* Click in **Create pull request**;
* Click in **Merge pull request** if the review was validated and if the reviewer didn't merged himself. 

Finally you can locally remove the branch do:
```bash
git checkout dev
git pull
git branch -D <branch_to_delete>
```
